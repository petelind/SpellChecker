# SpellChecker
{AppSec} This is command line context-dependent spellchecker - it takes as argument text file user was assumingly working with, then list of words to be spell-checked, then produces set of most probable words user was intending to use (based on the analysis of the text we seen before).
To run it do:

`python Spell_Checker.py --vocabulary big.txt --source test.csv --destination submission.csv --log yes`
